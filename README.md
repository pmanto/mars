<h2>Symfony 4</h2>
<p>For the microserivce I've decided to use Symfony 4, because I know that currently you are woking with this one. 
Also, if you check https://symfony.com/releases, symfony 4.4 has now a long maintened version. Not critical here, because it's just a challenge that is going to be use one time. But that's also another reason to choose Symfony 4 at this moment. </p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p>Here, I have to be honest, It's my first time setting all the docker configs and images, of course I know docker, I've worked with docker but mostly it was just running the command and that's it. I've learned a lot, so I'm glad I did it, but also I know it's not perfect, so I'll continue learning more because I'd enjoyed it. I'm using apache because I'm more use to and it's simpler, but of course, I'm open to work with nginx, regarding that, if you want to access to the app, you have to go to http://0.0.0.0:8060/ once the docker is running, using `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up`</p>
